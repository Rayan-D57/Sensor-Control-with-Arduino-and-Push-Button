Light Control Project Using a Push Button
Description:
This project is a simple light control system using a push button and an Arduino microcontroller. The goal of the project is to turn the light on only when the button is pressed and turn it off when the button is not pressed, thereby conserving electrical energy.

How It Works:
1. When the Button is Pressed: A signal is sent to the Arduino to turn on the light.
2. When the Button is Not Pressed: The light is automatically turned off.

Main Components:
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno).
- Push Button.
- LED lamp or any light source.
- Resistor (to protect the circuit).
- Connecting wires.

Benefits of the Project:
- Energy Conservation: The light is only turned on when needed, helping to reduce energy consumption.
- Simplicity: Simple and easy-to-implement design.
